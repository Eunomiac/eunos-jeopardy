/**
 * Buzzer Queue Manager for Real-Time Buzzer System.
 *
 * This service manages the in-memory buzzer queue for the host, tracking
 * all player buzzes with reaction times and determining the fastest player
 * for automatic focusing. It handles late buzz corrections when faster
 * buzzes arrive after slower ones.
 *
 * **Responsibilities:**
 * - Maintain ordered list of buzzes by reaction time
 * - Determine current fastest player
 * - Handle late buzz insertions and corrections
 * - Provide queue state for UI display
 * - Track buzz history for current clue
 *
 * **Queue Ordering:**
 * - Buzzes sorted by reaction time (fastest first)
 * - Late buzzes automatically inserted in correct position
 * - Duplicate buzzes from same player ignored
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * ```typescript
 * const queueManager = new BuzzerQueueManager();
 *
 * // Add buzz
 * queueManager.addBuzz('player-1', 'Alice', 450);
 * queueManager.addBuzz('player-2', 'Bob', 380);
 *
 * // Get fastest player
 * const fastest = queueManager.getFastestPlayer(); // 'player-2' (Bob, 380ms)
 *
 * // Get full queue for display
 * const queue = queueManager.getQueue();
 *
 * // Clear for next clue
 * queueManager.clear();
 * ```

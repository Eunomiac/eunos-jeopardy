/**
 * Broadcast Service for Real-Time Buzzer Communication.
 *
 * This service manages Supabase Realtime broadcast channels for immediate
 * buzzer communication between host and players. It provides type-safe
 * methods for broadcasting and receiving buzzer events with <50ms latency.
 *
 * **Architecture:**
 * - Uses Supabase Realtime broadcast (not postgres_changes)
 * - Ephemeral communication for time-sensitive events
 * - Database writes follow broadcasts for persistence
 * - Self-receive enabled for host to see own broadcasts
 * - No acknowledgment required (speed priority)
 *
 * **Channel Naming:**
 * - Format: `game-buzzer:${gameId}`
 * - One channel per game
 * - Automatically cleaned up on unsubscribe
 *
 * **Performance:**
 * - Target latency: <50ms typical, <100ms p99
 * - Non-blocking operations
 * - Immediate UI updates
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Host unlocks buzzer
 * await BroadcastService.broadcastBuzzerUnlock(gameId, clueId);
 *
 * // Player subscribes to events
 * const subscription = BroadcastService.subscribeToGameBuzzer(gameId, {
 *   onBuzzerUnlock: (payload) => enableBuzzer(payload.timestamp),
 *   onPlayerBuzz: (payload) => lockBuzzer(),
 * });
 *
 * // Cleanup
 * subscription.unsubscribe();
 * ```
 *
 * @since 0.2.0

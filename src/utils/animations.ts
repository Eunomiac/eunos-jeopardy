/**
 * GSAP Animation Initialization for Euno's Jeopardy
 *
 * This file initializes GSAP and exposes it globally for debugging purposes.
 * All animation logic is now handled by AnimationDefinitions.ts.
 *
 * Initialize once in main.tsx:
 * ```typescript
 * initializeAnimations();
 * ```
 *
 * IMPORTANT STYLING NOTE:
 * - All elements receiving animations should have the "gsap-animation" class,
 *   which sets autoAlpha: 0 (visibility: hidden & opacity: 0) to avoid
 *   FLASH of UNanimated content (FOUA)
 * - Elements are revealed by setting autoAlpha: 1 (visibility: visible & opacity: 1)
 *
 * @see src/services/animations/AnimationDefinitions.ts for animation implementations

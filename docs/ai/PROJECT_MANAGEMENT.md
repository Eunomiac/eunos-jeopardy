  - **Row Selection**: Weighted random based on authentic Jeopardy! data
    - Row 1 (lowest values): 0% chance
    - Row 2: 9% chance
    - Row 3: 26% chance
    - Row 4: 39% chance
    - Row 5 (highest values): 26% chance
- Basic validation: required columns, proper round structure, 6 categories √ó 5 clues per round
- **Reference**: See `docs/ai/DAILY_DOUBLE_ALGORITHM.md` for complete algorithm specification
- **Deferred to Phase 3**: In-app clue editor, drag-and-drop Daily Double placement, advanced validation

**Phase 3 Enhancements**:
- In-app clue set editor with rich UI

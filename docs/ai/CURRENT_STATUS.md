## 🚀 **Next Immediate Actions**

### Priority 1: ✅ COMPLETE - Phase 2 Daily Double Features
**Status**: 🟢 **COMPLETE** - Daily Double detection, visual indicators, and workflow integration
**Location**: `docs/ai/issues/3b. Continuation of Clue Implementation.md`
**Commit**: Phase 2 complete - Daily Double features implemented

**Remote Agent Completed (PR #6 - Merged but Broken)**:
- ✅ **ClueService**: Complete service layer (277 lines) with clue lifecycle management
- ✅ **GameService Enhancements**: Added focused clue/player management methods
- ✅ **Database Schema Updates**: Added focused_clue_id, focused_player_id, completed fields
- ✅ **Interactive Game Board**: Clickable clue cells with visual state management
- ✅ **Core Workflow Methods**: handleClueSelection(), handleRevealClue(), handleAdjudication()
- ✅ **Buzzer Queue Architecture**: Service layer methods for buzzer management

**CRITICAL Issues Requiring Immediate Fix**:
1. **Fix 22 TypeScript compilation errors** - All tests broken, codebase fails to build
2. **Complete buzzer queue UI integration** - Service layer exists but no UI display
3. **Fix database query syntax errors** - ClueService.initializeClueStates() malformed
4. **Fix method parameter mismatches** - GameService calls with wrong signatures
5. **Remove unused variables** - buzzerQueue and handlePlayerSelection declared but unused

### Priority 2: Future Enhancements
- **Multimedia clue support** - Images, audio, and video clues (Phase 3)
- **Advanced game features** - Wagering, Final Jeopardy, tournament modes
- **Public deployment** - Multi-tenant hosting and user management (Phase 4)

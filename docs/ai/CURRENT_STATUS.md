**Sprint**: CSV Question Set Loader

---

## 🎯 **Current Focus**

### Active Issue: #2 CSV Question Set Loader
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (95% complete - only missing drag-and-drop UI integration)
**Priority**: 🔴 High (Foundation)

**Current State**:
- ✅ **CSV Parser**: Complete with comprehensive validation (388 lines)
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Full clue set saving with relationships (612 lines)
- ✅ **Daily Double Algorithm**: Implemented with authentic probability distribution
- ✅ **Database-Driven Selection**: ClueSetSelector now queries user's clue sets from database
- ✅ **Clue Set Management Components**: ClueSetSummary and DeleteClueSetButton implemented
- ✅ **Upload Service**: File validation, duplicate checking, and upload processing
- ✅ **SCSS Styling**: Following established Jeopardy theme patterns
- ❌ **Drag-and-Drop UI Integration**: Need to add drag-and-drop handlers to App.tsx

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- 🎯 **Add drag-and-drop event handlers** to game creation screen (~30 lines)
- 🎯 **Implement user prompts** for clue set naming and duplicate handling (~40 lines)
- 🎯 **Test end-to-end workflow** from file drop to game creation (~1 hour)
- 📊 **Estimated completion time: 1-2 hours** (nearly complete!)

## 🚀 **Next Immediate Actions**

### Priority 1: Complete Issue #2 - CSV Question Set Loader
1. **Implement CSV file upload component** - Drag-and-drop interface for CSV files
2. **Build CSV parser with validation** - Parse CSV format: `round,category,value,clue,answer`
3. **Integrate Daily Double algorithm** - Automatic placement using authentic probability distribution
4. **Add error handling** - Validation for malformed CSV files and proper user feedback
5. **Test with example CSV files** - Ensure end-to-end clue set creation workflow

### Priority 2: Resume Issue #3 - Game Host Dashboard
1. **Load real clue data** - Replace hardcoded game board with actual clue set data
2. **Implement clue selection** - Make game board interactive for clue selection
3. **Build buzzer queue system** - Real player buzz-in functionality
4. **Add game flow controls** - Clue reveal, adjudication, and round progression

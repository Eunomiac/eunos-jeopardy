# Current Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-18, 12:30 PM
**Phase**: 1 - Private Development
**Sprint**: Issue #3c - GameHostDashboard Modifications - ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 **GAMEHOST DASHBOARD MODIFICATIONS COMPLETE** ✅

**Build Status**: ✅ Clean build with no TypeScript errors, all diagnostic issues resolved
**Integration Status**: ✅ Complete host dashboard with professional score adjustment and buzzer auto-selection
**Game Flow**: ✅ Enhanced host experience with smart latency compensation and timing controls

### Major Accomplishments This Session:
1. **✅ Score Adjustment System**: Replaced single "Adjust" button with intuitive "+" and "-" buttons
2. **✅ Input Validation**: Proper validation with buttons disabled when no value entered
3. **✅ Absolute Value Logic**: Subtract button uses absolute value to prevent counterintuitive behavior
4. **✅ Buzzer Auto-Selection**: Configurable timeout (100-5000ms) automatically selects fastest player
5. **✅ Smart Queue Sorting**: Buzzer queue always sorted by reaction time (fastest first)
6. **✅ Visual Indicators**: "AUTO" badge for auto-selected players, gold borders for selected players
7. **✅ Late Buzz Handling**: Late buzzes still appear in queue to show latency issues to host
8. **✅ Timing Fix**: Clue timeout cleared when first player buzzes (prevents conflicts with latency timer)
9. **✅ Client-Side Implementation**: Simple, efficient timeout management without complex database calls
10. **✅ Code Quality Excellence**: Eliminated infinite re-render issues, clean React patterns

**Ready for Next Phase**: Issue #5 - Advanced Game Features (Daily Double wagering, Final Jeopardy)

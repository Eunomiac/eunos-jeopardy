## 🚀 **Next Immediate Actions**

### Priority 1: ✅ COMPLETE - Phase 2 Daily Double Features
**Status**: 🟢 **COMPLETE** - Daily Double detection, visual indicators, and workflow integration
**Location**: `docs/ai/issues/3b. Continuation of Clue Implementation.md`
**Commit**: Phase 2 complete - Daily Double features implemented

**Remote Agent Completed (PR #6 - Merged but Broken)**:
- ✅ **ClueService**: Complete service layer (277 lines) with clue lifecycle management

## 🚀 **Next Immediate Actions**

### Priority 1: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Issue #4 Simplified Player Interface
**Status**: 🟡 **PLANNING** - Design decisions documented, ready for implementation
**Location**: `docs/ai/issues/4. Simplified Player Interface.md`

**Key Design Decisions Made**:
- **Background**: Desktop-only focus, `bg-stage.webp` with `#0b002a` fallback color only
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Completely deferred to Phase 4 (may never happen)
- **Buzzer Display**: Integrated with clue display as unified modal/overlay over central podium area
- **Animation**: Bounce-scale animation for buzzer button entrance when host clicks "Reveal Prompt"
- **Visual Theme**: Authentic TV show aesthetic using actual Jeopardy set screenshots
- **Buzzer Timing**: Client-side timing calculation eliminates latency compensation complexity

**Next Steps**: Implement PlayerGame component with client-side buzzer timing system

**Remote Agent Completed (PR #6 - Merged but Broken)**:
- ✅ **ClueService**: Complete service layer (277 lines) with clue lifecycle management
- ✅ **GameService Enhancements**: Added focused clue/player management methods
- ✅ **Database Schema Updates**: Added focused_clue_id, focused_player_id, completed fields
- ✅ **Interactive Game Board**: Clickable clue cells with visual state management
- ✅ **Core Workflow Methods**: handleClueSelection(), handleRevealClue(), handleAdjudication()
- ✅ **Buzzer Queue Architecture**: Service layer methods for buzzer management

**Current Code Quality Issues**:
1. **ESLint warnings** - Arrow function parentheses, accessibility issues, unused variables
2. **SCSS deprecation warnings** - @import rules and color functions need modernization
3. **Complete buzzer queue UI integration** - Service layer exists but no UI display
4. **Accessibility improvements** - Interactive elements need keyboard support and ARIA labels

### Priority 2: Future Enhancements
- **Multimedia clue support** - Images, audio, and video clues (Phase 3)
- **Advanced game features** - Wagering, Final Jeopardy, tournament modes
- **Public deployment** - Multi-tenant hosting and user management (Phase 4)

# Issue #3 Completion Plan

**Current Status**: 60% Complete - Foundation Implemented
**Target**: 100% Complete with 90%+ Test Coverage
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical (Blocking other issues)

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Must Fix First)

### 1. Database RLS Policy (BLOCKER)
**Issue**: Games table missing INSERT policy for authenticated users
**Error**: `"new row violates row-level security policy for table 'games'"`
**Impact**: Cannot create games, blocking all functionality
**Solution**: Add RLS policy in Supabase dashboard
```sql
-- Add this policy to games table
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own games" ON games
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = host_id);
```

### 2. Test Suite Failures (8 failing tests)
**Issue**: GameCreator component tests failing due to mocking and element selection issues
**Impact**: Coverage at 71.61% instead of 90%+ target
**Failing Tests**:
- `should render game creator with clue sets` - Multiple elements with same text
- `should create game successfully` - Missing "Creating Game..." text
- `should handle game creation error` - Error message not displayed
- `should handle clue sets loading error` - Error message not displayed
- `should prevent creation without clue set selection` - Validation message missing
- `should display clue set information` - Multiple elements with same text
- `should reset form after successful creation` - Success message missing

**Root Causes**:
- Supabase client mocking incomplete
- Component state not properly updated in tests
- Element selectors finding multiple matches
- Async operations not properly awaited

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Complete Implementation)

## Dependencies

### Completed Prerequisites
- âœ… Issue #1: Simplified User Management System
- âœ… Issue #2: CSV Question Set Loader
- âœ… GameService foundation with all CRUD operations
- âœ… Basic component structure and navigation

### External Dependencies
- Supabase Realtime enabled for the project
- RLS policies configured correctly
- Test environment properly mocked

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Database RLS Policy**: Blocks all functionality until resolved
- **Test Failures**: Prevents confident deployment and further development

### Medium Risk
- **Real-time Complexity**: Supabase Realtime integration may have edge cases
- **Race Conditions**: Buzzer ordering needs careful handling

### Low Risk
- **UI Polish**: Cosmetic improvements can be iterative
- **Performance**: Current architecture should scale adequately

---

**Next Immediate Action**: Fix RLS policy and resolve test failures to unblock development.

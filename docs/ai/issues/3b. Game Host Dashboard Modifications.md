## Mission: Consolidate the Game Host Dashboard into 4 Panels Instead of 6

### Component Reorganization

#### Buzzer Control Panel

1. Move buzzer control functionality into the "Clue Control" panel.
  - "Unlock Buzzer" should be a button next to the "Reveal Prompt" button
  - The color of the button should indicate the current state of the buzzer, rather than have a separate buzzer status indicator
  - The keyboard help text can be removed.
2. Move Connection & Latency Status information into the "Buzzer Queue" panel.
  - Both of these should appear on a single line, with latency compensation aligned right: `Connection Status: ACTIVE                                Latency Compensation: ACTIVE`
  - This report panel should appear at the top of the Buzzer Queue panel, directly below the header
3. The "Buzzer Control" panel can now be safely removed.

#### Game Status Panel

1. Remove the footer with "Created" and "Host"
2. Move all other elements into the "Player Control" panel, at the top, right below the header.
  - The format can remain unchanged.
3. The "Game Status" panel can now be safely removed.

### Panel Reorganization

The full-screen grid container should be rearranged to satisfy the following `grid-area` layout (whether or not `grid-area` is actually used):

```css
grid-template-areas:
  "player-control buzzer-queue board-control"
  "player-control buzzer-queue clue-control";
```

Both the "Player Control" and "Buzzer Queue" panels will occupy their own column. The "Board Control" and "Clue Control" panels will share the third column.

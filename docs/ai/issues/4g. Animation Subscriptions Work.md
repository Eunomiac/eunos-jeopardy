# Issue #4g: Animation Subscriptions Work

## "Instant" Animations for Initial State
Base CSS for game components initializes them as visibility: hidden to avoid FOUC. From this point, there are two options:
- **Option 1**: The standard animation is called and run, animating in the board. This should only happen when the subscription calls for it (i.e. game status changes to "game_intro")
- **Option 2**: If the standard animation has already been run (e.g. a player has reloaded the page afterwards), we don't want the animation to run again---but we can't leave the components hidden. Instead, the component should be instantly set to the post-animation state.  (Could this be done simply by calling the animation but setting its duration to 0? Or should we define an "instant" version of each animation?)
  - This is slightly complicated by, e.g., the category introduction animation:  We already have code that sets the initial state of the category strip based on the current category, which should likely be folded into this strategy of simply applying an "instant animation" to wherever the board should be when the player reloads.

## Comprehensive Debugging
- Add console log calls throughout the animation flow, including:
  - When an animation is played
  - When an animation is skipped (i.e. Option 2 above)
  - When an animation completes
  - Subscription-relevant logging in AnimationOrchestrator and AnimationEvents (e.g. publishing an intent, subscribing to an intent)

*This issue ensures that animations work correctly for initial component state and provides comprehensive debugging to ensure smooth operation.*

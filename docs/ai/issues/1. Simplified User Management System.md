# Issue #1: Simplified User Management System (For In-Dev Use)

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ High (Foundation)
**Epic**: User Management
**Actual Time**: 30 minutes

## Overview

Implement extremely simplified functionality to track users and logins. This is a bare-minimum approach to unblock game development - ignore authentication and security concerns for now.

## Goals

- **Primary**: Get users connected quickly to continue development
- **Secondary**: Enable basic host/player identification for game mechanics
- **Tertiary**: Set up minimal foundation for future proper auth

## Super Simple Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Test Users in Supabase (5 minutes)

**1.1 Manual User Creation**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Users
- Click "Add user" and create 2-3 test accounts:
  - `host@test.com` / `1234` (for testing host features)
  - `player1@test.com` / `1234` (for testing player features)
  - `player2@test.com` / `1234` (for testing multiplayer)
- **Skip** email verification - just create them directly

**1.2 Verify Database Integration**
- Check that user records appear in `auth.users` table
- Verify existing RLS policies work with these test users
- No changes needed to database schema

### Step 2: Basic Auth Context (15 minutes)

**2.1 Create Minimal Auth Context**
```typescript
// src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  loading: boolean;
}

// Just wrap Supabase auth calls, no complex error handling
```

**2.2 Integration**
- Wrap App with AuthProvider
- Expose user state and login/logout functions
- Handle session restoration on page refresh

### Step 3: Minimal Login UI (10 minutes)

**3.1 Simple Login Form**
```typescript
// src/components/auth/SimpleLogin.tsx
- Two input fields: email, password
- One login button
- One logout button (when logged in)
- Show current user email when logged in
- No validation, no error handling, no styling
```

**3.2 Basic Integration**
- Add login form to main page or as overlay
- Show/hide based on auth state
- Redirect or update UI when logged in

## File Structure (Minimal)

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AuthContext.tsx          (30 lines)
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ auth/
        â””â”€â”€ SimpleLogin.tsx      (40 lines)
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Can log in with test accounts created in Supabase
- [x] User state is available throughout the app
- [x] Can log out and log back in
- [x] Session persists on page refresh
- [x] Ready to build game features with user identification

## What We're Skipping (For Now)

- User registration forms
- Password validation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and spinners
- Protected routes
- Profile management
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Security considerations
- Proper styling
- Unit tests

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Test with all 3 accounts** to verify basic functionality
2. **Proceed immediately to Issue #2** (CSV Question Set Loader)
3. **Use user.id for host/player identification** in game mechanics
4. **Come back to proper auth** when game features are working

## Future Enhancement Phases

### Phase 3 Near-Future (When Game Works)
- Proper user registration form
- Basic error handling and validation
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Session management improvements

### Phase 3 Public Release (Much Later)
- Email verification flow
- Password reset functionality
- User profiles and preferences
- Advanced security and RLS policies
- Rate limiting and security headers

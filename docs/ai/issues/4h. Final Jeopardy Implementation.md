Game Flow:

- After all "double"-round clues have been resolved, the "Next ROund" button is enabled (just as it should be enbaled after all "jeopardy"-round clues have been resolved, to transition to the "double" round)
- The host clicks "Next Round" --> Game status changes to "final"
- Subscription effects:
  - All players with negative scores are barred from playing (no wagering, no buzzing, no scoring)
  - the Final Jeopardy animation plays:
    - The dynamic display window (which should be visibility: hidden at this point) is populated with the `public/assets/images/splash-final-jeopardy.webp' image
    - The dynamic display window fades in and scales up to fill the standard display size
    - The "Final Jeopardy" splash fades out to reveal the CATEGORY of the Final Jeopardy clue
    - Finally, all eligible players are shown a wager input, where they can silently enter their wagers.  (Ineligible players should remain on the category display, i.e. the previous step)
  - the Host dashboard should reflect which players have entered their wagers, ideally with a simple marker next to their names in the Player Control panel
  - once all wagers have been entered, the Host should be able to click a button to reveal the clue prompt to all players
  - an input box should then be displayed to all players for them to type in their answer (again, with ineligible players remaining on the clue prompt display, and with an indicator on the host dashboard showing which eligible players have entered in their answers)
  - a timeout should begin (during which time the Jeopardy theme will play), after which time the text input is locked
  - the Host should then conduct the flow of play with simple button clicks, following this sequence:
    - lowest-scoring player to highest-scoring player
    - their ANSWER is displayed on their player podiums to all players on first click of the Host's control button (we will need to add a "final jeopardy wager" and "final jeopardy answer" element to each of the player podiums for this purpose)
      - the Host then marks "correct" or "incorrect", which then fades in the player's wager (to all clients) AMD adjusts the player's score accordingly
    - next click of the Host's control button moves to the next player

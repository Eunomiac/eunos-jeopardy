# Issue #4: Simplified Player Interface (Voice-Chat Focused)

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Assignee**: Development Team
**Epic**: Player Experience
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (Next Major Development Phase)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 development sessions

---

## 📋 **Issue Overview**

Build a streamlined player interface optimized for Discord voice chat gameplay. The interface focuses on buzzer functionality since answers are communicated verbally, with minimal text input required only for Final Jeopardy.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Voice-First Design**: Players communicate answers verbally via Discord
- **Desktop-Only Focus**: Mobile responsiveness completely deferred to Phase 4 (may never happen)
- **Minimal Complexity**: Clean, focused interface without unnecessary features
- **Real-time Responsive**: Immediate feedback and game state synchronization
- **Authentic Visual Theme**: Use actual Jeopardy set screenshots with `bg-stage.webp` background

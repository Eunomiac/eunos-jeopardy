1. I've implemented a "Condition Coverage on New Code" requirement of >= 80% on SonarQube. Is our test reporter exporting condition coverage data (specifically in the github workflow)? If not, can you please configure it to do so?

2. I'm receiving deprecation warnings in the Github workflow report relating to use of Node v.18.  Can you please update to a more modern version, and then update the .nvmrc file accordingly? (We may also have to update our action versions --- `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, etc., and we should verify all tests are still passing after the upgrade.)

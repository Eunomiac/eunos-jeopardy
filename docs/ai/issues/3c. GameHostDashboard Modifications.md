# GameHostDashboard Modifications

## Player Control Panel
### Score Adjustment Functionality
- the "Adjust" input and button are currently `disabled`, likely hardcoded that way (but check to make sure it isn't actually a bug in otherwise fully implemented code!)
- replace the "Adjust" button with a "+" button and a "-" button.
	- when no number has been entered into the input field, both should be disabled
	- when the "+" button is clicked, it should add the value in the input field to the player's score
	- when the "-" button is clicked, it should subtract the **absolute** value of the input field from the player's score (this is so entering "-200" and then hitting "-" doesn't actually add 200 to the player's score, which would be counterintuitive)
- the input element itself should be enabled once the host starts the game

## Buzzer Queue
### Latency Compensation & Automatic Buzzer Resolution
- when the first player is added to the buzzer queue, a timeout (default 500ms) should start
- when this timeout completes, the player in the queue with the fastest time should be automatically selected
- replace the latency compensation button with a number input field
- whenever this number changes, its value is stored to the game table --- this is the amount of milliseconds the automatic buzzer resolution timer should use (and as such, it should default to 500 ms in the database)

## Clue Control
### Buzzer Timeout Delay
- if the host selects "Unlock Buzzer" too quickly after clicking "Reveal Prompt", the timeout doesn't function
- it appears to be instantly cancelled: the timeout display flashes briefly before disappearing

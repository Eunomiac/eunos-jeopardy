# Issue #3: Game Host Dashboard

**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (70% complete - Clue management implementation in progress)
**Assignee**: Development Team
**Epic**: Game Control
**Priority**: üî¥ High (Active development - clue management system)
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15

## Description
Create host interface for game control, buzzer management, and answer adjudication. This is the central control panel where hosts manage live Jeopardy games, control the buzzer system, adjudicate player answers, and manage game flow through all rounds.

### Functional Context
A game of Euno's Jeopardy is meant to be played while all participants are in a voice chat room (e.g. Discord). Most game actions are handled verbally, with the Game Host Dashboard used to manage game flow: Players select clues, make wagers on Daily Doubles, and respond to clue prompts verbally. The dashboard provides the host with the tools needed to facilitate this voice-driven gameplay experience.

### üéØ **Game Flow Control Sequence**

The following sequence describes the complete flow of control for a single clue during gameplay:

1. **Clue Selection**: The `Focused Player` verbally chooses a category and a value.

2. **Host Clue Selection**: The `Host` clicks the corresponding clue in the Board Control panel. This makes it the `Focused Clue`, and highlights it on both the Game Host Dashboard as well as the player-facing UI.

3. **Player Confirmation**: The `Focused Player` gives verbal confirmation that this is the clue they selected.

4. **Reveal Prompt**: The `Host` clicks "Reveal Prompt", which displays the clue prompt to all players.

5. **Host Reads Clue**: The `Host` reads the clue prompt aloud.

6. **Buzzer Unlock**: When the `Host` finishes reading, he unlocks the buzzer via the Buzzer Control panel, causing the buzzer to light up on the player-facing UI.

7. **Player Buzzes & Selection**: Once a player has buzzed in, the `Host` selects their name in the Buzzer Queue panel, which makes that player the `Focused Player` (and removes `Focused Player` status from the previous `Focused Player`), and automatically locks the buzzer.

8. **Response Request**: The `Host` tells the `Focused Player` to give their response verbally.

9. **Adjudication**: Once the `Focused Player` gives their response, the `Host` uses the "Mark Correct" or "Mark Wrong" buttons to adjudicate the answer and award or penalize the `Focused Player`'s score. The correct response is visible to the `Host` in the Clue Control panel but is never displayed to players - the `Host` simply states verbally whether the answer is correct.

10. **Next Clue**: After one of the "Mark ..." buttons is clicked, we return to step #1, with the `Focused Player` choosing a new clue.

### üéØ **Implementation Notes**
- **Voice-Chat Integration**: All verbal interactions (clue selection, wagers, answers) handled through Discord/voice chat
- **Desktop-First Design**: Phase 3 optimized for desktop/laptop users (1920x1080+ screens)
- **Real-time Architecture**: Supabase Realtime for immediate state synchronization across all players
- **State Management**: Focused Player and Focused Clue concepts for clean workflow management
- **Latency Compensation**: Fair buzzer timing accounting for connection speed differences

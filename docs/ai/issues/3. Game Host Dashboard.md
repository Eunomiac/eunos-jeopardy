- [ ] **Adjudicate answers (correct/incorrect)** - Host controls scoring decisions with immediate score updates
- [ ] **Manage scoring and wagers** - Handle Daily Double and Final Jeopardy wagers
- [ ] **Control game flow (rounds, Final Jeopardy)** - Progress through game states and rounds

### User Experience
- [ ] **Real-time updates** - All changes immediately visible to host and players
- [ ] **Clear visual feedback** - Obvious states for buzzer lock/unlock, player actions
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful handling of network issues and invalid states
- [ ] **Loading states** - Clear feedback during async operations
- [ ] **Keyboard accessibility** - Host controls accessible via keyboard shortcuts

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Real-time subscriptions** - Use Supabase Realtime for live updates
- [ ] **Host authorization** - Only game host can access control functions
- [ ] **Data persistence** - All game state saved to database
- [ ] **Race condition handling** - Proper buzzer ordering with concurrent events
- [ ] **90%+ test coverage** - Comprehensive test suite following established patterns

## Visual Design & User Interface

### Design Philosophy
The Game Host Dashboard should mimic the authentic Jeopardy! game show experience as closely as possible. Reference the design images in `docs/design-images/` for visual guidance:

- **`Jeopardy Board.jpg`** - Shows the classic game board layout with categories and dollar values
- **`Jeopardy Question.jpg`** - Displays how clues should be presented during gameplay
- **`Jeopardy Answer.jpg`** - Shows the answer reveal format and styling

### Visual Requirements

#### Color Scheme & Branding
- **Primary Blue**: Deep Jeopardy blue (#060CE9 or similar) for main backgrounds
- **Gold Accents**: Bright gold (#FFD700) for borders, highlights, and active states
- **White Text**: High contrast white text on blue backgrounds
- **Black Backgrounds**: For clue text areas and answer reveals
- **Status Colors**: Green for correct answers, red for incorrect, yellow for pending

#### Typography
- **Headers**: Bold, sans-serif fonts reminiscent of the game show
- **Clue Text**: Large, readable fonts for clue display
- **UI Text**: Clean, modern fonts for controls and interface elements
- **Monetary Values**: Distinctive styling for dollar amounts ($200, $400, etc.)

#### Layout Structure

- Only game host can adjudicate answers
- Only game host can manage game flow and rounds
- Use existing RLS policies and `is_game_participant()` function

#### Data Validation
- Validate all user inputs before database operations
- Ensure game state consistency (can't unlock buzzer without active clue)
- Prevent duplicate buzzer events from same player
- Validate score changes and wager amounts

### Integration Points

#### Existing Systems
- **Authentication**: Use existing AuthContext for user management
- **Clue Sets**: Integrate with ClueSetSelector for game creation
- **Database**: Leverage existing Supabase client and type definitions
- **Styling**: Follow established SCSS patterns and component structure

- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Batch database operations where possible
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Accessibility Requirements
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast visual states
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (spacebar for buzzer toggle)

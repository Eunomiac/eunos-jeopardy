# Remote Agent Task: Game Round Transition Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Mission Statement**
Implement host-controlled round transitions for Euno's Jeopardy, enabling smooth progression from Jeopardy â†’ Double Jeopardy â†’ Final Jeopardy rounds with proper animations, validations, and user feedback. This feature is critical for completing the core game flow and unblocking Final Jeopardy implementation.

## ðŸ“‹ **Primary Reference Document**
**READ THIS FIRST**: `docs/ai/features/GAME_ROUND_TRANSITION.md`

This comprehensive implementation plan contains:
- Complete current state analysis and existing infrastructure
- Detailed implementation phases with code examples
- Database schema updates required
- Service layer methods with full specifications
- Host dashboard UI changes and confirmation dialogs
- Animation system integration
- Testing strategy and success criteria

**All implementation details are in that document. This prompt provides workflow and quality standards.**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Requirements**

### **Architecture Principles**
1. **Host-Controlled Progression**: Host explicitly advances rounds via "Next Round" button
2. **Validation with Override**: Automatic enablement when complete, confirmation for early transitions
3. **Animation Integration**: Round transitions follow same pattern as game intro
4. **Progress Tracking**: Filter clue states by round for accurate progress
5. **Database Integrity**: Preserve all clue states for future reporting features

### **Key Features**
- **Automatic button enablement**: "Next Round" enabled when all clues completed
- **Confirmation dialog**: Warning when advancing with incomplete clues
- **Round transition animations**: Placeholder implementations matching game intro pattern
- **Category introductions**: Same flow as Jeopardy round start
- **Progress filtering**: Track only current round's clues in progress display
- **Debug helper**: "Complete Round" button (dev mode only) to instantly complete all clues for testing

## ðŸ“‚ **Implementation Phases**

Follow the phases exactly as outlined in `docs/ai/features/GAME_ROUND_TRANSITION.md`:

### **Phase 1: Service Layer & Validation** (4-6 hours)
- Add `ClueService.getCompletedCluesCountByRound()` method
- Add `ClueService.isRoundComplete()` method
- Add `GameService.transitionToNextRound()` method
- Add `GameService.getNextRound()` helper method
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all new methods

### **Phase 2: Database Schema Updates** (1-2 hours)
- Add `'round_transition'` to `game_status` enum in database
- Regenerate TypeScript types from Supabase
- Update type definitions in `src/types/game.ts`
- Update all type references throughout codebase

### **Phase 3: Host Dashboard UI** (6-8 hours)
- Update `calculateClueProgress()` to filter by current round
- Add `getCurrentRoundClueIds()` helper function
- Implement round completion state tracking
- Add `handleNextRound()` handler with validation
- Implement confirmation dialog component
- Enable "Next Round" button with proper logic
- Add confirmation dialog UI with styling
- Add debug "Complete Round" button (dev mode only) for testing

### **Phase 4: Animation System Integration** (4-6 hours)
- Enhance `RoundTransitionAnimation` implementation
- Update `AnimationOrchestrator` round detection logic
- Add post-animation status transition handling
- Test animation flow end-to-end with page reload scenarios

### **Phase 5: Testing & Validation** (4-6 hours)
- Write unit tests for service methods
- Write integration tests for UI flow
- Manual testing of all scenarios
- Test animation continuity on page reload
- Verify all acceptance criteria met

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Specifications**

### **Database Migration**
```sql
-- Add 'round_transition' to game_status enum
ALTER TYPE game_status ADD VALUE 'round_transition';
```

### **Status Flow**
```
in_progress â†’ [Host clicks "Next Round"] â†’ round_transition â†’
[Animation plays] â†’ introducing_categories â†’ [Categories introduced] â†’ in_progress
```

### **Round Progression**
- `jeopardy` â†’ `double` (30 clues each)
- `double` â†’ `final` (1 clue)
- `final` â†’ (no further progression)

### **Performance Targets**
- Round transition animation: ~2 seconds
- Category introduction: ~1 second per category
- Total transition time: ~8-10 seconds per round
- Button state updates: <100ms

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Implementation Notes**

### **DO Follow These Patterns**
- **Match game intro flow**: Round transitions should mirror the existing game intro pattern
- **Filter by round**: Progress tracking must filter clue states by current round
- **Preserve history**: Never delete or "un-flag" completed clues from previous rounds
- **Validate before transition**: Check round completion unless force flag is set
- **Clear focused state**: Reset focused_clue_id and focused_player_id on transition

### **DO NOT Do These Things**
- **Don't modify clue states from previous rounds**: Keep historical data intact
- **Don't skip validation**: Always check round completion unless explicitly forced
- **Don't allow transition beyond final**: Throw error if already at Final Jeopardy
- **Don't implement Final Jeopardy gameplay**: That's a separate feature (deferred)
- **Don't add backwards compatibility**: This is new functionality

### **Comments Should**
- Explain complex round filtering logic
- Document validation rules and edge cases
- Note animation timing and coordination
- Clarify status transition flow
- Describe integration with existing systems

# Remote Agent Task: Real-Time Buzzer Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Mission Statement**
Implement a real-time broadcast-based buzzer system for Euno's Jeopardy that provides immediate (<50ms) buzzer responsiveness while maintaining database integrity for game reports. This replaces the current database-driven buzzer system with a hybrid approach using Supabase Realtime broadcast for immediate UI updates and database as the authoritative source of truth.

## ðŸ“‹ **Primary Reference Document**
**READ THIS FIRST**: `docs/ai/features/REAL-TIME BUZZER.md`

This comprehensive implementation plan contains:
- Complete architecture overview and design principles
- Current system analysis and target architecture
- Detailed implementation phases with code examples
- Technical specifications for broadcast channels and payloads
- Success criteria and testing strategy

**All implementation details are in that document. This prompt provides workflow and quality standards.**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Requirements**

### **Architecture Principles**
1. **Broadcast for Immediacy**: All time-sensitive UI updates via Supabase Realtime broadcast
2. **Host as Database Authority**: Only Host writes to database (eliminates race conditions)
3. **Database as Source of Truth**: Database updates can override broadcast state
4. **Client-Side Timing**: Players calculate reaction times locally (eliminates latency bias)
5. **Automatic Selection**: Fastest player immediately focused (no manual host selection required)

### **Key Features**
- **<50ms buzzer response**: From unlock to player UI update
- **Automatic player focusing**: Fastest buzz immediately selected across all clients
- **Late buzz correction**: Faster late buzzes automatically override slower early buzzes
- **Manual override capability**: Host can manually change focused player for edge cases
- **Database backup**: All buzzes recorded for game reports and state recovery

## ðŸ“‚ **Implementation Phases**

Follow the phases exactly as outlined in `docs/ai/features/REAL-TIME BUZZER.md`:

### **Phase 1: Broadcast Infrastructure** (4-6 hours)
- Create `BroadcastService.ts` for channel management
- Define broadcast event types and payloads
- Implement type-safe broadcast/receive methods

### **Phase 2: Host Implementation** (6-8 hours)
- Update `GameHostDashboard.tsx` with broadcast channel
- Implement automatic player focusing logic
- Create `BuzzerQueueManager.ts` for queue management
- Update buzzer lock/unlock to broadcast first, then database

### **Phase 3: Player Implementation** (6-8 hours)
- Update `PlayerDashboard.tsx` with broadcast channel
- Remove direct database writes from players
- Implement broadcast-driven buzzer state changes
- Handle late buzz corrections

### **Phase 4: State Management Updates** (4-6 hours)
- Update `BuzzerStateService.ts` for real-time flow
- Ensure instantaneous state transitions
- Add late correction handling

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Optimization** (4-6 hours)
- Remove deprecated auto-selection timeout logic
- Remove manual player selection requirement (keep override button)
- Remove latency compensation code
- Update all tests for new architecture

### **Phase 6: Documentation and Polish** (2-4 hours)
- Update `docs/ai/features/BUZZER_SYSTEM.md`
- Add monitoring and debugging features
- Document manual override procedures

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Specifications**

### **Broadcast Channel Configuration**
```typescript
const channel = supabase.channel(`game-buzzer:${gameId}`, {
  config: {
    broadcast: { 
      self: true,  // Host receives own broadcasts
      ack: false   // Don't wait for acknowledgment (speed priority)
    }
  }
});
```

### **Event Types**
- `buzzer_unlock`: Host signals buzzers are now active
- `buzzer_lock`: Host signals buzzers are now locked
- `player_buzz`: Player submits buzz with reaction time
- `focus_player`: Host or system sets focused player

### **Performance Targets**
- **Broadcast latency**: <50ms typical, <100ms p99
- **Lock response**: <50ms from unlock broadcast to player UI update
- **Buzz response**: <50ms from player click to all clients locked
- **Focus update**: <50ms from buzz broadcast to focused player change
- **Database backup**: <500ms from broadcast to database confirmation

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Implementation Notes**

### **DO NOT Retain Deprecated Code**
- **Remove** auto-selection timeout logic (no longer needed)
- **Remove** manual player selection requirement (keep override button only)
- **Remove** latency compensation code
- **Remove** player database writes to `buzzes` table
- **Do not** add deprecation warnings or backwards compatibility
- **Do not** add comments referencing changes or what was removed

### **Comments Should Only**
- Explain complex logic that remains
- Document security considerations
- Note performance optimizations
- Describe integration points
- Clarify non-obvious behavior

### **Database Writes**
- **Only Host** writes to database
- Players broadcast buzzes, Host records them
- Database updates follow broadcasts (~500ms later)
- Database can override broadcast state if different

### **Late Buzz Handling**
- All clients track fastest buzz received
- Faster late buzzes immediately override slower early buzzes
- Visual flash acceptable (<100ms duration)
- Database update confirms correct player

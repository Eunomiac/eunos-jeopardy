# Obsolete Code: Deprecated animateBoardIntro Method

## Location
`src/services/animations/AnimationService.ts` (lines 121-129)

## Description
The `animateBoardIntro` method is marked as deprecated with a comment stating:
```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Use BoardIntroAnimation from AnimationDefinitions instead
 * This method is kept temporarily for backwards compatibility.
 */
```

The method simply forwards to `BoardIntroAnimation.execute()` from AnimationDefinitions.

## Assessment: OBSOLETE CODE

### Reason
This is **obsolete backwards compatibility code** that should be removed because:
1. The project guidelines explicitly state: "This app is a hobby project and does not need to be backwards compatible"
2. The method is not used anywhere in the codebase
3. The replacement (`BoardIntroAnimation` from AnimationDefinitions) is fully implemented and working
4. The comment says it's "kept temporarily" - that temporary period has ended

### Verification
- ✅ Searched codebase for usages: None found
- ✅ Checked for dynamic calls: None found
- ✅ Confirmed replacement exists: BoardIntroAnimation is fully implemented
- ✅ Reviewed git history: Method was deprecated when AnimationDefinitions was created

### Impact of Removal
- **Lines of code removed**: 9 lines (including JSDoc comment)
- **Files affected**: 1 file
- **Breaking changes**: None - method is not used
- **Test coverage impact**: None - method has no tests

## Recommendation
**REMOVE** - This deprecated method serves no purpose and violates the project's "no backwards compatibility" principle. The replacement is fully functional and already in use throughout the codebase.

## Implementation Plan
1. Remove the `animateBoardIntro` method from AnimationService.ts (lines 121-129)
2. Run TypeScript compiler to verify no errors
3. Run tests to confirm nothing breaks
4. Commit with message: `chore(animations): remove deprecated animateBoardIntro method`

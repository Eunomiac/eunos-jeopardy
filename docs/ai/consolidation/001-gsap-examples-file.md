# Unnecessary Code: gsap-examples.tsx

## Location
`src/utils/gsap-examples.tsx`

## Description
This file contains example React components demonstrating GSAP animation patterns. It includes 6 example components and 1 custom hook:
- `ClueRevealExample`
- `BuzzerExample`
- `ScoreAnimationExample`
- `ComplexAnimationExample`
- `AutoAnimationExample`
- `useGSAPAnimation` (custom hook)
- `CustomHookExample`

## Assessment: UNNECESSARY CODE

### Reason
This file is **not imported or used anywhere in the application**. It was created as reference documentation for developers but:
1. No components import from this file
2. No tests reference these examples
3. The actual animation system has been fully implemented in `src/services/animations/`
4. Documentation for animations exists in `docs/ai/reference/ANIMATION_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md`

### Verification
- ✅ Searched codebase for imports: None found
- ✅ Checked for dynamic imports: None found
- ✅ Reviewed git history: File was created as examples, never used in production code
- ✅ Confirmed no external dependencies: Safe to remove

### Impact of Removal
- **Lines of code removed**: 247 lines
- **Files affected**: 1 file (deletion only)
- **Breaking changes**: None - file is not used
- **Test coverage impact**: None - file has no tests

## Recommendation
**REMOVE** - This file serves no purpose in the codebase. The animation patterns it demonstrates are either:
1. Already implemented in the actual AnimationService
2. Documented in the ANIMATION_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md
3. Obsolete (references to custom GSAP effects that don't exist)

## Implementation Plan
1. Delete `src/utils/gsap-examples.tsx`
2. Run diagnostics to confirm no errors
3. Run tests to confirm nothing breaks
4. Commit with message: `chore(utils): remove unused gsap-examples file`

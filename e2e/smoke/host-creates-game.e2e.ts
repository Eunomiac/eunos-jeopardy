/**
 * Smoke Test: Host Creates Game
 *
 * This test validates the critical path for a host to create a new Jeopardy game.
 * It's called a "smoke test" because it checks if the core functionality works
 * without testing every detail - like checking if there's smoke coming from a machine
 * to see if it's running.
 *
 * **What This Test Validates:**
 * - Host can log in with valid credentials
 * - Host can select a clue set from the dropdown
 * - Host can click "Host Game" button
 * - Game dashboard appears after game creation
 * - Game is created in the database (verified by dashboard presence)
 *
 * **Why This Is Important:**
 * This is the most critical user journey in the application. If this doesn't work,
 * nothing else matters. This test should run fast and catch major breakages.
 *
 * **LEARNING NOTE: Test Structure**
 * Every test follows the AAA pattern:
 * - ARRANGE: Set up the test (navigate, prepare data)
 * - ACT: Perform the action being tested (click, type, etc.)
 * - ASSERT: Verify the expected outcome (check URL, text, etc.)
 *
 * @see https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices

   * Without this cleanup, the second test would fail because:
   * 1. First test creates a game
   * 2. Game remains active in the database
   * 3. Second test logs in as host
   * 4. Host is redirected to the existing game (not the creation screen)
   * 5. Test fails because it expects to see the creation screen
   *
   * The afterEach hook runs after every test in this describe block,
   * cancelling any games created during the test.

 * NEXT STEPS:
 * - Run this test: `npm run test:e2e smoke/host-creates-game.e2e.ts`

/**
 * Smoke Test: Player Joins Game
 *
 * This test validates the critical path for a player to join an existing Jeopardy game.
 * It's called a "smoke test" because it checks if the core functionality works
 * without testing every detail - like checking if there's smoke coming from a machine
 * to see if it's running.
 *
 * **What This Test Validates:**
 * - Player can log in with valid credentials
 * - Player can see the "Waiting for Game" button
 * - Player cannot join a game until it's active
 *
 * **Why This Is Important:**

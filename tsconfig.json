/**
 * Root TypeScript Configuration - Project References
 *
 * This is the root TypeScript configuration that orchestrates the entire project
 * using TypeScript's "Project References" feature. It doesn't compile any files
 * itself (files: []), but instead coordinates multiple independent TypeScript
 * sub-projects that can be built separately and in parallel.
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * - Enables faster incremental builds by only rebuilding changed sub-projects
 * - Allows different parts of the codebase to have different compiler settings
 * - Improves IDE performance by isolating different contexts
 * - Enforces clear boundaries between app code, tests, and tooling
 *
 * **Referenced Projects:**
 * - tsconfig.app.json: Main application source code (React components, services)
 * - tsconfig.test.json: Unit and integration tests (Jest)
 * - tsconfig.e2e.json: End-to-end tests (Playwright)
 * - tsconfig.node.json: Build tooling (Vite, ESLint, Playwright configs)
 *
 * **Build Command:**
 * When you run `tsc -b`, TypeScript builds all referenced projects in dependency
 * order, skipping unchanged projects for faster builds.
 *

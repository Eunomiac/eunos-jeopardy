# Testing Issues and Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10
**Branch**: improve-test-coverage-90
**Goal**: Achieve 90% test coverage across the codebase

## Current Status

### Test Results
- **Test Suites**: 27 passed, 27 total ‚úÖ
- **Tests**: 532 passed, 532 total ‚úÖ
- **Coverage**:
  - Statements: 80.72% (Target: 90%)
  - Branches: 81.48% (Target: 90%)
  - Functions: 75.5% (Target: 90%)
  - Lines: 80.72% (Target: 90%)

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Files Affected**: GameHostDashboard.tsx, PlayerDashboard.tsx

**Problems**:
- Unused variables causing TS6133 errors: `broadcastSubscription`, `buzzerUnlockTime`, `setShowClueModal`, `fastestPlayerId`
- Unused interface `BuzzPayload` causing TS6196 error
- Property access errors: `userId` and `nickname` don't exist on `PlayerInfo` type

**Solutions**:
- Used underscore for unused destructured values (e.g., `const [, setBroadcastSubscription] = useState(...)`)
- Removed unused `BuzzPayload` interface
- Fixed property access to use correct `PlayerInfo` properties (`id` instead of `userId`, `name` instead of `nickname`)
- Kept `showClueModal` variable without setter as it's used in code

**Commit**: 8a74fa4

#### 2. GameService Test Failure (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**File**: GameService.test.ts

**Problem**:
- `getPlayers` test expected players without `profiles` field, but service now adds this field

**Solution**:
- Updated test expectation to include `profiles: null` field in result

**Commit**: 8a74fa4

#### 3. BroadcastService Mock Missing (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**File**: GameHostDashboard.test.tsx

**Problem**:
- Tests failing with "channel.unsubscribe is not a function" errors
- BroadcastService not mocked, causing real subscription attempts

**Solution**:
- Added `jest.mock('../../services/realtime/BroadcastService')`
- Mocked `subscribeToGameBuzzer` to return proper subscription object with `channelId` and `unsubscribe` method

**Commit**: 7bc3021

**Result**: 23/26 GameHostDashboard tests now passing

### Remaining Test Failures

#### 1. GameHostDashboard Integration Tests (3 failures)
**Tests**:
- `should start game successfully from lobby state`
- `should handle start game error`
- `should display join times for players`

**Analysis**:
These appear to be timing-related integration test issues. The tests are checking for async operations (game start, animations, real-time updates) that may not complete within the test timeouts. These are complex integration scenarios that may require:
- Longer wait times
- Better animation service mocking
- More comprehensive async operation handling

**Priority**: LOW - These are integration tests for already-implemented features. Focus should be on adding unit tests for uncovered code.

#### 2. PlayerDashboard Tests (Status: NOT YET INVESTIGATED)
**File**: PlayerDashboard.test.tsx

**Next Steps**: Investigate failures and apply similar mocking strategies as GameHostDashboard

#### 3. App Tests (Status: NOT YET INVESTIGATED)
**File**: App.test.tsx

**Next Steps**: Investigate failures - likely related to component integration issues

## Coverage Strategy

### High Priority Files (0% Coverage)
These files have significant business logic and should be tested:

1. **App.tsx** (824 lines, 0% coverage)
   - Main application routing and game flow logic
   - Consider Istanbul comments for complex integration code

2. **GameHostDashboard.tsx** (2,617 lines, 0% coverage)
   - Already has test file with 23/26 tests passing
   - Need to investigate remaining failures
   - May need Istanbul comments for animation/real-time code

3. **PlayerDashboard.tsx** (1,138 lines, 0% coverage)
   - Already has test file but all tests failing
   - Need to fix test setup (likely similar to GameHostDashboard)

4. **Animation Services** (multiple files, 0% coverage)
   - AnimationService.ts (480 lines)
   - AnimationDefinitions.ts (686 lines)
   - BuzzerStateService.ts (253 lines)
   - ClueDisplayService.ts (134 lines)
   - GameStateClassService.ts (296 lines)
   - **Strategy**: Add Istanbul comments - these require DOM manipulation and GSAP integration testing

5. **Player Components** (0% coverage)
   - ClueRevealModal.tsx (200 lines)
   - IntegratedBuzzer.tsx (168 lines)
   - PlayerPodiums.tsx (186 lines)

### Medium Priority Files (Partial Coverage)
1. **GameService.ts** (71.22% coverage)
   - Add tests for uncovered methods
   - Lines 107-120, 149-160, 177-239, etc.

2. **ClueService.ts** (42.28% coverage)
   - Add tests for uncovered initialization and state management methods

3. **FontAssignmentService.ts** (0% coverage)
   - Has test file but needs more comprehensive tests

### Files to Exclude with Istanbul Comments
Based on testing strategy documentation, these should be excluded:

1. **Animation Services** - Require DOM manipulation and GSAP integration
2. **Real-time Subscription Code** - Requires WebSocket integration testing
3. **Complex Database Transactions** - Better suited for integration tests

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. ‚úÖ Fix failing GameService test
3. ‚úÖ Add BroadcastService mock to GameHostDashboard tests
4. üîÑ Investigate and fix PlayerDashboard test failures
5. üîÑ Investigate and fix App test failures
6. ‚è≥ Add Istanbul comments to animation services
7. ‚è≥ Add tests for uncovered GameService methods
8. ‚è≥ Add tests for uncovered ClueService methods
9. ‚è≥ Add tests for player components (ClueRevealModal, IntegratedBuzzer, PlayerPodiums)
10. ‚è≥ Review coverage report and identify remaining gaps

## Notes

- Following anti-over-mocking guidelines from TESTING_MOCKS_REFERENCE.md
- Using Istanbul comments for integration-heavy code as per TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- Committing progress regularly to avoid losing work
- Focusing on meaningful tests that verify behavior, not implementation details
